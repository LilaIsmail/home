		<h3>Recruiting</h3>
		<p> 
			The NHL recruits players from many different leagues but more-so from North American based leagues 
			such as the OHL and the AHL. The players can be recruited from try-outs, scouting, and through drafts. 
			The bottom 14 teams in the league's standings are put into a lottery for who gets first pick. The 
			picture below shows last year's first round draft pick, Connor Mcdavid who was drafted by the 
			Edmonton Oilers and is now one of the best players in the league&#8252;;
